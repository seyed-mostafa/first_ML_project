    "In this assignment, a Jupyter Notebook is prepared for examining almost all critical factors in designing a Machine Leaning model for a supervised learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete this notebook to build a ML model, and apply it to a binary classification problem. Additionally you will get familiar with varoius factors which may enhance the performance of a ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will take advantage of four principal python libraries for data science and machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Numpy](https://numpy.org): The fundamental package for **scientific computing** with Python.\n",
    " - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): An open source **data analysis and manipulation tool**, built on top of the Python programming language.\n",
    " - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) : A comprehensive library for **creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations** in Python.\n",
    " - [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org): Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis and building Machine Learning models.\n",
    " \n",
    "**After this assignment you will be able to:**\n",
    "1. Run Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and know how to prepare data for a predictive model.\n",
    "2. Build and apply a Machine Learning model for a supervised learning problem using known frameworks.\n",
    " \n",
